### Motivation
<br>
For my Software Design class, our final project was to create an interactive project that uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. For many, including my team, this task involved creating a game. [Alex](https://github.com/a-matsoukas) and I worked to create the Snake Game. You can find our code and read how to play our game [here](https://github.com/olincollege/snake-game).

### Reflection

<br>

This project gave me an opportunity to practice a lot of skills, both soft and technical. It increased my confidence in reading API documentation, as we frequently referenced pygame. I also had an opportunity to write a game I was familiar with from scratch and translate the rules of the game into the MVC architecture. Communication and using Git on a team project have also been useful on many projects since this one.

<br>

Looking back now, creating this game and being familiar with the code gave me an easy way to implement [reinforcement learning](http://lila.engineer/snake-game-reinforcement-learning/), allowing me to focus on the math rather than how to implement it with a game. The MVC architecture made it easy to add additional controllers.

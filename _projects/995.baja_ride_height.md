### Motivation

<br>

Baja SAE is a college-level off-road vehicle competition, where teams build a car, almost from scratch, to compete in a 4-hour endurance race. I am part of Olin's Baja SAE team. To be able to tune our CVT better and gather data for our new 4-wheel drive design, we are placing wheel speed sensors on all four wheels. After communicating with suspension, they would also be interested in having ride height sensors on all of knuckles as well.

<br>

### Details

<br>

In order to receive signals from multiple sensors on all four wheels, we decided to create to relay these signals to the main data acquisition board, which will then store the data on an SD card and send the data wirelessly back to the pit. 

The module must also be connected to the CANbus, meaning SPI to CAN modules were needed.

### Reflection

<br>

This project was my first time making a PCB from start to finish.

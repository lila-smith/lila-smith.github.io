### Motivation
<br>
For my Software Design class, our final project was to create an interactive project that uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. For many, including my team, this task involved creating a game. [Alex](https://github.com/a-matsoukas) and I worked to create the Snake Game. You can find our code and read how to play our game [here](https://github.com/olincollege/snake-game).

### Reflection

<br>

This project gave me an opportunity to practice both soft and technical skills. It increased my confidence in reading API documentation, as we frequently referenced pygame. Using a game that I was familiar with let me translate the rules of the game into the MVC architecture, starting from scratch. Communication and using Git on a team project have also been useful on many projects since this one.

<br>

Creating this game and being familiar with the code gave me an easy way to implement [reinforcement learning](http://lila.engineer/snake-game-reinforcement-learning/), allowing me to focus on the math rather than how to implement it with a game. The MVC architecture made it easy to add additional controllers.

## Background
The quality and rate at which vegetation occurs in a ponic farm strongly correlates to the degree in which environmental variables are controlled.

## Description
The motivation of this project is to develop a controlled platform while conducting horticulture experiments.  Identified as Project Autonomous Control Environment, or ACE, this unit bears the capability to fully automate the farming process without any user input.  It is retrofitted from a functioning Craigslist upright freezer and equipped with a number of environmental control systems to ensure consistent and reliable grow data throughout the obseration process.  Further included are novel sensory designs to better quantify the outcome of experimentation.

This illustration marks the transition in which our startup has made - specifically in the field of research and development.  In learning about our team's core compentencies, we've realized our strengths in precision engineering and intend to explore this capability in a niche setting.

## First Grow
From components gathered at the local hardware store, a loosely defined aeroponic was developed using two storage containers, PCV tubing, an aquarium pump, water irrigators, grow medium, and a florescent lightbulb.  Completely exploratory, a fertilizer designed for tomato plants was dissolved into the water solution and irrigated continuously for approximately 60 days.  Lettuce seeds were used in the study.

The experiment, as conducted during my junior undergraduate year, was an eye-opening experiment that truly brought attention to the consequences of an uncontrolled experiment.  It revealed concepts that I'd later realize were fundamental to Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).  Fundamentally, we're orchestrating biological cycles to be as complementary as possible.

## Second Grow and MakerFaire

As I built a reputation among my university peers as a farming entrepreneur, I was eventually given an invitation to present my work and represent my school in the Detroit Maker Faire.

I presented my work on biofilters and demonstrated the effect of maintaining water quality.  It became very apparent from my first study that water quality is of special importance in aquaponic systems; in addition to balancing the health of both fish and plants, a third component must be tended to: microrganisms.  My study demonstrates the contrast between no filtering capacity, only mechanical filtering, and complementary filtering.

It was an amazing opportunity to talk with adults and children of a full spectra of interests; though clearly biased, I sensed a consensus that this was something people were interested in and wanted to do themselves.

## Embedded System Monitoring and Control

Continuing down the path of controlling environmental parameters, it quickly became apparent as to the burden of making manual measurements at specific time intervals.  With a growing interest in embedded systems, I began to develop my own all-inclusive monitoring system to automate this aspect of my work.

Without knowing explicitly which parameters to monitor, a broad selection was made initially and refined from observations.  Data was saved to a microSD card for the purposes of interpretation on a computer.

## Horticultural LEDs

The next obvious issue in controlling plant growth was its supply of energy: photosynthetic light.  Being subject to the cyclical temperment of midwestern climate, relying on a consistent supply of natural sunlight was identified as an uncontrolled parameter.

WIth LED technology improving and dropping in price, one viable approach was to experiment with a plant's physiological behavior under rigidly prescribed light doses.  Using Illumitex modules as a rapid means of experimentation, a light fixture was designed with the intent of cultivating aquaponically-grown greens.

## Commercial Hydroponics

Conveniently for us and our location, commercial-level hydroponic farms were emerging in greenhouses, and even warehouses.  With our backgrounds in manufacturing, this quickly took the form of LEAN manufacturing; there became a growing need to increase the quality of produce while simultaneously lowering the cost of production.

## Consumer Product

Our interest grew in the consumer marketspace; compared to the competing products, we saw a niche opportunity to develop a product gauged towards control.  Doing so would increase the overall quality of produce, and perhaps facilitate a cultural shift from a mono-distributed food platform to a much more dispersed system.

### Motivation

<br>

For my class, Design Nature, our goal was to create a bio-inspired mechanism that would "hop" with a limited set of materials. It also must have had a "trigger" mechanism, a way for it to hop at a time after it has been placed into its starting position. For my animal, I chose the [springtail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu01EUeE5PM&ab_channel=AntLab). 

<br>

### Details

<br>
My hopper used lasercut eucaboard as its main structure. Dowels were used to link the main body to the tail and as a support for the path of the actuator, a piece of rubber tubing. In its primed position, the trigger mechanism was a small piece of wooden dowel, attached to the main body, inserted into a piece of rubber tubing, attached to the tail.

You can see a video of it in action [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/F2dVgvmXK5yi2BoE6). Like a springtail, it spins many times and gains height.
